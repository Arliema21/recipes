                <h2>Procedure</h2>
                
                <ol  class="procedure">
                    <li>Preheat oven at 200Â°C</li>
                    <li>Place whipping cream and sifted in a medium sized bowl, mix well together and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Take one and a half of the frozen salted egg (keep what is left of the frozen salted egg inside the freezer) and grate it using the side of the grater with holes. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Put the cream cheese and sugar together in a mixing bowl. Using a paddle attachement, turn on to medium speed for 1 minute. Turn off the mixer and scrape the sides of the bowl to make sure that the cream cheese and sugar are incorporated.
                        Turn on the mixer and switch speed to medium high, mix for 30seconds then scrape the sides of the bowl again.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs in two batches. Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix well after each addition.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour and cream mixture. Mix on low to medium speed until well incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Fold in the grated salted eggs.</li>
                    <li>Pour cheesecake onto prepared pan to reach the rim of the pan or the banana leaf liner.</li>
                    <li>Put in the oven and bake for 36 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While cheesecake is baking, take 2 salted eggs from the refrigerator and slice them into 12 wedges.</li>
                    <li>On the 20th minute take out the cheesecake, lightly press the 12 wedges of the salted eggs on the top of the cheesecake like a clock.</li>
                    <li>Place the cheesecake back inside the oven and continue baking.</li>
                    <li>Once 36minutes is over, switch off the oven, slightly open the door. Keep the cheesecake inside the oven for 12 minutes to start carry-over cooking.</li>
                    <li>Remove cheesecake from the oven to cool to room temperature before placing inside the fridge. Chill for 4hours or overnight.</li>
                    <li>Pipe some cream on the top rim of the cheesecake; be careful not to cover the salted eggs.</li>
                    <li>Springkle some grated salted egg, toasted coconut and cheese on the top of the cream for additional detail and flavor.</li>
                    <li>Slice and serve!</li>
